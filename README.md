## About

This repo shows some examples where I have used Swift to create user interfaces and mini practice projects in preparation for final projects week.

## Technologies used
1. Swift

## Skills used/learned
1. Add/edit constraints
2. Add in a photo and adjust sizing so that it fits the screen
3. Creating basic user interfaces which allow the View to be responsive to different iPhone screen sizes
4. Add/edit/delete labels and backgrounds

## Project synopses

1. AppTwo: created a basic user interface in Swift using dynamic constraints, labels, background and image resizing
2. FizzBuzz: created a simple test called BrainTest. I used TDD in this project and build a passing test which allows a Boolean response to return 'true' when asked a question.
